# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

Loads the ggplot2 graphics package
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric","Date",numeric"))
```
                                                    
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
gg <- ggplot(activity,aes(x=date,y=steps))+geom_histogram(colour="blue", fill="blue", stat="identity")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean.steps = mean(activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
median.steps = median(activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
mean.steps
median.steps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
